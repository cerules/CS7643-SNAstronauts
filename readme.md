# CS7643 Project
## Alex Newhouse, Christopher Roth, David Wu

## Data

We use the data from the Iron March forum leak, which has been packaged into an [R library by Brendan Knapp](https://github.com/knapply/ironmarch).

## Environment

_**TODO**: update conda env files with latest packages_

_env.yml_ file can be used to recreate python environment used to run the project with Anaconda

_env-history.yml_ is the conda environment generated with the `conda env export --from-history` command.

after the python packages are installed run `nltk_prerequisites.py` to install the necessary nltk stop words and punctuation datasets
