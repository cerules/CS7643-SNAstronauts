# CS7643 Project

## Data

Data comes from [IronMarch Exposed](https://www.ironmarch.exposed/).
More specifically the [blackhole link](https://app.blackhole.run/#lhPJK0wufT1MXMfQyxHy1ovzHYCeLzviajx65idcbHXU) at the bottom of the website

## Environment

_**TODO**: update conda env files with latest packages_

_env.yml_ file can be used to recreate python environment used to run the project with Anaconda

_env-history.yml_ is the conda environment generated with the `conda env export --from-history` command.

after the python packages are installed run `nltk_prerequisites.py` to install the necessary nltk stop words and punctuation datasets
